  <p>Lemonade is a sweetened lemon-flavored beverage.</p>

   <p>There are varieties of lemonade found throughout the world.[1] In North America and South Asia, cloudy still
     lemonade is the most common variety. There it is traditionally a homemade drink using lemon juice, water, and a 
     sweetener such as cane sugar, simple syrup or honey.
     In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Central Europe and Australia, a carbonated lemonade soft drink is more common.
      Despite the differences between the drinks, each is known simply as "lemonade" in countries where it is dominant.</p>

    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Lemon Juice</li>
    <li>Ice</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Start by firmly rolling the lemons around on the counter. This will help 
        release the juices and make your job a lot easier. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise, then squeeze out the juice
         by hand or with a juicer. 
        Make sure to juice the lemons over a large measuring cup so you can see exactly how much liquid you have. </li>

        It's shockingly simple to make simple syrup on the stove. Just combine sugar and water in 
        a small saucepan, bring the mixture to a boil, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved. </li>    
     <li>
        Pour cold water into a pitcher. Stir in lemon juice and pulp, then add simple syrup to taste. 
        </li>
      <li>Serve over ice. If you're feeling fancy, garnish each glass with a fresh lemon slice or a candied lemon peel.
