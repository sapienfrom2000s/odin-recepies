    <p>Tempura (天ぷら or 天麩羅, tenpura, [tempɯɾa]) is a typical Japanese dish usually consisting of seafood, meat and vegetables
         that have been battered and deep fried. The dish was introduced by the Portuguese in Nagasaki through fritter-cooking
          techniques in the 16th century. The word ‘tempura’ comes from the Latin word tempora, a term referring to times of
           fasting when the church dictated that Catholics go meatless.</p>
